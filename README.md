# fl00dz (Flow)
Ultimate goals for Flow, a single block that can be set to pump or flood mode.
GUI with configurable power source, allow the user to chose weather to power the
device with RF, Mana, Essentia or LP (via block inventory slot for a blood orb). 

Configurable option to replace liquids it picks up with the block type specified in
the config (stone by default) 

By setting this value blank blocks will not be replaced (useful for skymaps)
